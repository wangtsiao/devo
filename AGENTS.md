# AGENTS.md

## Rust

This repository is a Rust-based coding agent, currently called `devo`.
- All crate names use the `devo-` prefix. For instance, the crate in the `core` directory is named `devo-core`.
- When using `format!`, inline variables directly inside `{}` whenever possible.
- Always collapse nested `if` statements according to https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#collapsible_if
- Inline `format!` arguments whenever possible, following https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#uninlined_format_args
- Prefer method references instead of closures where applicable, per https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#redundant_closure_for_method_calls
- Avoid using `bool` or unclear `Option` parameters that lead to ambiguous calls like `foo(false)` or `bar(None)`. Instead, use enums, clearly named methods, newtypes, or other idiomatic Rust patterns that improve readability at the callsite.
- If such API changes are not feasible and positional literals must still be used, follow the `argument_comment_lint` rule:
  - Add an exact `/*param_name*/` comment before unclear positional literals (e.g., `None`, booleans, numeric values).
  - Do not include these comments for string or character literals unless they genuinely improve clarity, as these are exempt.
  - The comment must exactly match the parameter name in the function signature.
- Make `match` expressions exhaustive whenever possible, avoiding wildcard arms.
- Any newly introduced traits must include documentation explaining their purpose and how implementations should behave.
- In tests, favor comparing full objects rather than asserting on individual fields.
- If an API is added or modified, update the relevant documentation in the `docs/` directory when necessary.
- Avoid introducing small helper functions that are only used once.
- Keep modules reasonably sized:
  - Prefer creating new modules instead of expanding existing ones.
  - Aim to keep modules under 500 lines of code, excluding tests.
  - If a file grows beyond ~800 lines, place new functionality in a separate module unless there is a strong, documented justification not to.
- When running Rust-related commands (e.g., `just fix` or `cargo test`), allow them to complete without interruption, do not try to kill them using the PID. Slow execution due to Rust’s locking behavior is expected.
- Agent can not apply patch to a file more than 800 lines, cause windows patch length limit, agent would failed to apply patch.
- Do not introduce trivial wrapper functions — call the underlying function directly unless reuse or abstraction is clearly justified.
- Exclude the target folder when using glob or grep, since it contains a large number of Rust build artifacts.

## Tests

### Test assertions

- Use `pretty_assertions::assert_eq` in tests to produce clearer diffs. Import it at the top of the test module if it’s not already present.
- Prefer deep equality checks by asserting entire objects instead of comparing fields individually.
- Do not mutate process environment variables in tests; instead, pass environment-dependent values or flags explicitly from higher levels.
- Tests that involve filesystem paths or other platform-dependent behavior MUST be platform-aware:
  - Use `#[cfg(windows)]` and `#[cfg(unix)]` to define platform-specific test cases when behavior differs.
  - Never rely on Windows-style paths being interpreted correctly on Unix, or Unix-style paths on Windows.
  - Always use platform-native path formats in tests so they align with `std::path::Path` semantics.

### InteractiveMode product TUI (tmux / psmux)

When verifying the **product** path (`target/debug/devo` → Node InteractiveMode), use a real TTY under **tmux** or **psmux** (Windows: winget `marlocarlo.psmux`; set `DEVO_TMUX_BIN` if it is not on `PATH`). Do **not** assert exact model reply text — assert turn activity (user bubble, thinking, assistant output, and/or tool use).

```bash
# Session name may be any label; this example uses the binary path as the name.
tmux new-session -d -s .\target\debug\devo -x 80 -y 24

# Wait for startup, then capture output
sleep 3 && tmux capture-pane -t .\target\debug\devo -p

# Send input
tmux send-keys -t .\target\debug\devo "your prompt here" Enter

# Send special keys
tmux send-keys -t .\target\debug\devo Escape
tmux send-keys -t .\target\debug\devo C-o  # ctrl+o

# Cleanup
tmux kill-session -t .\target\debug\devo
```

On Windows PowerShell with psmux, prefer an absolute binary path and an explicit cwd, for example:

```powershell
$tmux = $env:DEVO_TMUX_BIN  # or full path to psmux.exe
$devo = (Resolve-Path .\target\debug\devo.exe).Path
& $tmux new-session -d -s devo-repro -c (Get-Location) -x 100 -y 30 $devo
Start-Sleep -Seconds 4
& $tmux capture-pane -t devo-repro -p
& $tmux send-keys -t devo-repro "Say hello in one short sentence." Enter
Start-Sleep -Seconds 30
& $tmux capture-pane -t devo-repro -p
& $tmux kill-session -t devo-repro
```

Slash commands to spot-check under the same TTY path (do not assert exact model text):

- `/model` — opens model selector (Esc to close)
- `/effort` — opens effort selector
- `/system-prompt` — prints server-owned system prompt note in chat
- `/goal` — status line (“No active goal” or current objective); `/goal <text>` sets; `/goal pause|resume|clear` mutate

Scenario harness (markers / T1–T3): `apps/tui` → `npm run test:tmux` (`scripts/tmux-tui-smoke.ps1` / `.sh`).

## Protocol and Session Settings

Per L2-DES-APP-008 and L2-DES-CONV-002 (both Approved):

- The Native protocol (`crates/protocol/src/native/`) is the single retained surface. New features land on Native only; legacy-shaped handlers only shrink and are deleted in Phase E. During migration, legacy handlers translate into the Native path — never maintain parallel implementations.
- External protocols (ACP, future A2A) are pure adapters: transport + projection, zero business logic. Their wire behavior is pinned by `protocol-lock.json` and must not drift mid-migration.
- Session settings changes go through canonical `session/metadata/update` with `SessionSettingsPatch` (partial semantics: only present fields change). Do not add per-concern settings methods.
- Settings writes are persist-first: field-level rollout lines (`InternalRecordV2::SessionSettings`) written synchronously by the handler, which never waits on the session actor; actor notification is best-effort (`SessionHandle::notify_*`). Replay prefers field lines over whole-record `SessionMeta` values.
- Mid-turn effect rides the turn-inline override (`TurnInlineState.live_turn_settings`, `sandbox_profile_live`). Every live setting must declare its decision point and mid-turn semantics in the DD-6 promise matrix of L2-DES-CONV-002 before implementation.
- Session actor vs turn isolation: see `L2-DES-SERVER-002` and `crates/server/AGENTS.md`. Actor mailbox commands must stay short; turns run on a spawned task with `TurnWorkingSet` and re-enter via `MergeTurn`.
