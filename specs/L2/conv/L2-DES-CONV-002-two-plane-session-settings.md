# L2-DES-CONV-002 — Two-Plane Session Settings

## Purpose

Define the architecture, API contract, and per-setting promises for updating session settings at any time, including during an active turn, with immediate persistence and deterministic effect timing. Refines L1-REQ-CONV-006.

## Scope

This document covers:
- The two-plane state model (session plane / turn plane) and state ownership rules
- The unified settings update API and its promises
- The write path (persist-first), read path (decision points), and recovery path
- Field-level settings persistence and epoch semantics
- The turn control plane and settings override channel
- Per-setting decision points and mid-turn semantics
- Phased rollout, risks, and mitigations

This document does **not** cover:
- Permission profile semantics themselves (see L2-DES-SAFETY-001)
- Approval solicitation and caching mechanics (see L2-DES-SAFETY-002)
- Queue/steer message semantics (see L1-REQ-CONV-003 and its L2)

## Current State (Audit Summary)

**Historical (pre L2-DES-SERVER-002):** settings writes and many reads flowed through the session actor mailbox while `ExecuteTurn` ran unbounded model/tool I/O inline on that same task. Mid-turn RPCs that awaited the mailbox appeared to hang for the turn duration.

**Current (after L2-DES-SERVER-002):** turns check out a `TurnWorkingSet` and run on a spawned task; the actor mailbox stays short-command only. Settings writes use the persist-first path below. Remaining risks are incomplete control-plane coverage and merge races—not a blocked mailbox.

- `session/metadata/update` is the unified settings write. It persists first,
  notifies the actor best-effort, and returns without waiting for an active turn
  to finish.
- The settings-only path resolves durable sessions from the rollout/index even
  when no session actor has been resumed. Actor hydration is not a precondition
  for persistence; an actor is required only for live notification or for
  ephemeral sessions that have no durable record.
- Persistence uses field-level `InternalRecordV2::SessionSettings` lines (plus
  legacy dual-write where still present); crash loss is bounded by the sync
  append, not the turn duration.
- Live mid-turn effect rides `TurnInlineState` overlays (`sandbox_profile_live`,
  `live_turn_settings`) per DD-5/DD-6.
- Queue (session plane, durable) vs steer (turn plane, ephemeral channel);
  two-level session/turn approval caches; per-turn cancellation tokens.

## Design Decisions

### DD-1: Two planes, and every piece of state declares its plane

The session plane is the durable plane: it owns cross-restart, cross-turn truth. The turn plane is the execution plane: it owns ephemeral, per-execution state derived from the session plane and merged back at turn end.

**Decision**: every settings-related state is explicitly classified as session-durable, session-runtime, turn-ephemeral, or turn-produced-and-merged. Turn-plane state is never persisted; session-plane state is never written by a turn directly (merge at turn end is the only crossing). The system already follows this model implicitly (queue/steer, session/turn approval caches, `TurnInlineState` merge); this design makes it explicit and extends it to settings.

### DD-2: One user-facing API with a complete promise; two internal paths

User intent is atomic ("change this setting"); the API surface must be too.

**Decision**: the unified entry point is the canonical `session/metadata/update` (`SessionSettings` patch + `expected_version`), extended with `{ epoch, applied_to_active_turn }` in its result — no separate `session/settings/update` method is invented (aligned with L2-DES-APP-008 DD-5). The handler internally executes two ordered paths: (1) session-plane persistence, then (2) turn-plane override delivery when a turn is active. Clients never issue two calls for default behavior. An optional `ephemeral: true` flag (turn-only, never persisted) is reserved pending the L1 open question.

Promises of the call:
- **Durability**: the change is persisted before success is returned; persistence failure yields an explicit error.
- **Response timing**: the response never waits for the session actor or an active turn.
- **Effect timing**: with an active turn, at the next decision point per field (DD-6); otherwise from the next turn. `applied_to_active_turn` reports which case applied.
- **Concurrency**: epoch last-write-wins; the resolved value is identical in memory, on disk, and after restart. `expected_version` provides optimistic concurrency against `Session.version`; **`0` skips the check** as a transitional escape for clients that do not track versions yet (removed when all first-party clients track versions).

### DD-3: Persist-first write path

**Decision**: the handler holds a short per-session metadata-write gate and performs: (1) synchronous append of field-level settings lines to the rollout store; (2) best-effort mailbox notification to the actor (epoch-tagged) to refresh its cached copies, update summary/record, clear caches, and broadcast; (3) when a turn is active, delivery of the override to the turn control plane (DD-5). Success is returned after durable append, without hydrating or waiting for an actor. Session resume uses the same gate so hydration cannot race a field-line write.

Why the mailbox notification can be best-effort: after L2-DES-SERVER-002 the actor mailbox stays short-command only, so `notify_*` is processed before the next turn's `CheckoutTurnWorkingSet` baseline snapshot; a crash is covered by the recovery path (DD-4). The actor never writes the live override channel; handlers do.

### DD-4: Field-level append-only settings log with epochs

**Decision**: settings are persisted as field-level append-only rollout lines `(session, field, value, epoch)`, superseding whole-record `SessionMeta` rewrites for settings. Recovery replays the log: the latest value per field wins, and the existing re-derivation logic (`crates/server/src/persistence.rs:1347`) seeds runtime state from it. The epoch is a per-session logical sequence number; replay continues numbering from the maximum seen. During migration, writers dual-write (record meta + field lines) and readers prefer field lines, falling back to `SessionMeta`; dual-write is removed per setting as its slice completes.

### DD-5: Turn control plane; settings override is an ephemeral channel

**Decision**: the mechanisms that reach into a running turn are unified as the *turn control plane*: the cancellation token, the steer channel, and a new settings-override channel. All share the same properties: ephemeral, die with the turn, consumed at decision points, never persisted, delivered without the actor mailbox. The override lives in `TurnInlineState` (already shared behind the active-stream lock, the same path used by mid-turn approval grants) and is written directly by handlers. Decision points synchronously read `effective = overlay ∪ baseline_snapshot`.

### DD-6: Per-field decision points and mid-turn semantics (promise matrix)

Each field declares the decision point at which a change becomes visible and the fate of in-flight work:

| Field | Decision point | Mid-turn semantics |
|---|---|---|
| permission preset / mode / sandbox | each tool-call authorization; each process spawn | Subsequent authorizations and spawns use the new profile; already-spawned processes run to completion; pending interactive approvals are not retracted and their explicit user grants are honored |
| model / model binding | each model call | The next model call in the turn uses the new model; the in-flight request completes; prompt-cache efficiency loss is expected and acceptable |
| reasoning effort | each model call | Same as model |
| collaboration mode | each system-prompt construction (per model call) | The next model call carries the new mode's prompt and tool policy; already-executed tool calls are unaffected. **Implementation status (Phase 4): deferred** — mode drives the session-context/system-prompt build, which is captured once per turn today; live mode requires per-iteration prompt rebuild and lands as a follow-up slice. Mid-turn mode changes currently take effect from the next turn. |
| effective context window (compaction limit) | session/new and session restore (model resolution); each auto-compaction check reads the resolved budget | The value is no longer client-settable: `effectiveContextWindow` patches are ignored and the response echoes the model-derived window, so a patch never changes when auto-compaction runs |

The effective context window is **model-derived, not client-settable**: the applied limit is the session model's usable window (`context_window × effective_context_window_percent / 100`), resolved by `resolved_compaction_limit` in `crates/server/src/runtime/context_occupancy.rs` at session/new and again on resume/restore. `session/metadata/update.settings.effectiveContextWindow` is accepted only as a legacy echo: absolute patches are ignored, the response reports the model-derived window, and nothing is written to `config.toml`. The former global `compaction_token_limit` config field has been removed from the schema; leftover keys in old `config.toml` files are ignored by serde (`resolved_compaction_limit` derives purely from the model). Persistence for this value is therefore per-model configuration (the model's `context_window` / `effective_context_window_percent`), not a per-session or global field-line setting.

**Permission/sandbox interaction (human-approved 2026-08-02)**: permission profile and sandbox profile are separate fields of the canonical `SessionSettings` — policy decision vs execution enforcement — and a single patch may change both atomically. The contractual interaction: when a patch changes `permission_profile` and omits `sandbox_profile`, the sandbox is re-derived from the new preset (`implied_sandbox_profile`, current `ApplyPermissionProfile` behavior); when the patch explicitly carries `sandbox_profile`, the explicit value wins.

Structural session state (cwd, tool registry composition, hook configuration) is excluded from live override and keeps turn-snapshot semantics; mid-turn changes there would make a single turn's behavior unattributable.

### DD-7: Cache invalidation by epoch

**Decision**: approval-cache grants are stamped with the settings epoch under which they were issued; grants from a stale epoch are ignored at authorization time. Explicit user approvals issued *after* the change are unaffected. Turn-scoped caches are cleared when an override is applied to a running turn. This replaces the current actor-side cache clearing, which cannot run during a turn.

### DD-8: Auditability

**Decision**: settings epochs are stamped into authorization decision traces (extending `trace_permission_decision`) and into turn records (epoch at turn start and end). This is a precondition for live behavior, not an optional extra: without it, mid-turn variability would make post-hoc investigation impossible.

### DD-9: Legacy method mapping and behavior change

**Decision**: the four legacy update methods map onto the unified write path (equivalent to one `session/settings/update` call each). Their observable behavior changes in one way: they no longer block until actor processing. This must be called out in the changelog. Deprecation of the legacy methods is deferred to the L1 open question.

### DD-10: Align the wire protocol with the canonical `SessionSettings`

The protocol layer currently carries two divergent models for the same concept: the canonical `SessionSettings` struct with `expected_version` optimistic concurrency (`crates/protocol/src/native/session.rs:128`, `native/rpc_session.rs:169`), and the legacy flat per-concern params (`crates/protocol/src/session.rs:289`, `permissions.rs:62`, `sandbox.rs:9`). This duplication is the source of much of the settings code sprawl.

**Decision**: per L2-DES-APP-008, canonical is the single retained protocol surface. The settings domain converges on the canonical `SessionSettings` model end-to-end: canonical `session/metadata/update` params → handler → settings log → core `TurnConfig`. The legacy flat params are kept only as deserialization aliases that translate into the canonical model at the handler boundary (L2-DES-APP-008 DD-4), then removed with the rest of the legacy surface. No new settings-specific types may be introduced outside the canonical model; where the canonical model lacks a concept needed here (e.g. `applied_to_active_turn` in the result), it is added to the canonical model rather than to a parallel one. The epoch from DD-4 is distinct from `expected_version`: the epoch orders settings writes and stamps traces; `expected_version` lets a client guard against overwriting a concurrent edit.

Note (2026-08-31): `SessionSettings.reasoning_effort` on the snapshot is the **raw selection string** — the same contract as `SessionSettingsPatch.reasoning_effort`, including the toggle keywords `enabled`/`disabled` that toggle/variant-style models use and the typed `ReasoningEffort` enum cannot express. The enum remains only on `Session.model.reasoning_effort` (`ModelBinding`), where it carries the resolved request-parameter semantics. Snapshots that parsed the selection through the enum silently dropped the toggle keywords and every client restored them as unset.

## Settings Inventory (Current Implementation)

| Setting | Write API → mailbox command | Mid-turn read points | Persistence |
|---|---|---|---|
| permission preset | `session/metadata/update.settings.permissionProfile` → `ApplyPermissionProfile` | mode: by-value capture (`turn_exec/query.rs:98`); profile: turn-inline (`approval.rs:487`); caches: turn-inline / actor | record-level `SessionMeta` (`handlers/session.rs:391`); recovery re-derives profile (`persistence.rs:1347`) |
| sandbox profile | `session/metadata/update.settings.sandboxProfile` → `ApplySandboxProfile` | admission: turn-inline (`approval.rs:576`); execution: `ToolRuntimeContext.sandbox_profile` per call (`core/tools/router.rs:277`) | record-level `SessionMeta` |
| model / binding / effort / collaboration mode | `session/metadata/update` → `UpdateSessionMetadata` | `TurnConfig` by value in the core query loop (`core/query/mod.rs:365`) | record-level `SessionMeta` + SQLite `upsert_session` |
| effective context window | `session/metadata/update.settings.effectiveContextWindow`: legacy echo only — absolute patches are ignored, the response carries the model-derived window, and `config.toml` is never written for this value | `session.settings.effective_context_window` / `session.config.token_budget` seeded from the model window at session/new and restore; compaction checks read the budget (`context_occupancy.rs`) | model-derived (`context_window × effective_context_window_percent / 100`); re-derived at session/new and on restore; no field-line or global-config write |

Note: the canonical protocol already defines a unified `SessionSettings` struct (`crates/protocol/src/native/session.rs:128`) and an `expected_version` optimistic-concurrency field on canonical update params; the wire-served handlers currently use the older flat params, and `SessionMetadataUpdateParams` exists in two divergent shapes (`crates/protocol/src/session.rs:289` vs `crates/protocol/src/native/rpc_session.rs:169`). Per L2-DES-APP-008, the settings domain rides the protocol unification: the canonical `session/metadata/update` is the single entry point (DD-10).

## Phased Rollout

Status (2026-08-02): **Phases 1–4 implemented.** Phase 5 (closeout) is in progress; dual-write removal waits for the legacy surface deletion (L2-DES-APP-008 Phase E).

1. **Phase 1 — Field-level settings log (persistence only, no behavior change).** ✅ Implemented: `InternalRecordV2::SessionSettings` + legacy `RolloutLine::SessionSettings` mirror; replay precedence and divergence logging in `persistence.rs`; the canonical sandbox settings patch now persists explicitly (previously lost on restart).
2. **Phase 2 — Persist-first write path + protocol alignment, permission preset first.** ✅ Implemented: dual-shape dispatch on canonical `session/metadata/update`; `SessionSettingsPatch` (partial semantics); `expectedVersion: 0` escape; best-effort `notify_*` actor methods; consolidated metadata notify (the actor overwrites absent fields on non-mode-only updates).
3. **Phase 3 — Turn override channel, permission first.** ✅ Implemented: overlay writes into turn-inline config + `sandbox_profile_live`; `authorize_tool_request` reads the live permission mode; the tool router reads the live sandbox handle per spawn; behavior test `settings_mid_turn::mid_turn_tighten_to_default_triggers_approval_for_network_tool`.
4. **Phase 4 — Remaining fields by template.** ✅ Implemented for model/effort/compact-limit via `LiveTurnSettings` + generation counter in the core query loop (behavior test `mid_turn_model_switch_reaches_next_model_request`). **Deferred**: collaboration mode mid-turn (needs per-iteration system-prompt rebuild); legacy methods remain until Phase E instead of becoming aliases (the TUI is already off them).
5. **Phase 5 — Closeout.** Remove dual-writes and stale read paths; mark actor config copies as caches; remove the legacy flat params after the deprecation deadline; update docs and `AGENTS.md`; full regression.

Rollback: Phase 1 removes the field-line reader branch; Phase 2 reverts the handler; Phase 3 disables overlay writes (readers see an empty overlay, falling back to next-turn semantics). Each phase is independently shippable.

## Phase 1 Implementation Notes (2026-08-02)

Findings that shape Phase 1, recorded during implementation:

- **The write path is already single-write v2**: `append_line` projects legacy `RolloutLine` through the per-file `LegacyProjector` into `RolloutLineV2` rows (`persistence.rs:693-792`); replay inverse-projects (`V2InverseProjector`) back into legacy lines for `ReplayState`. The field-level log therefore rides `InternalRecordV2` (the GoalState/UsageRecord precedent), not a new top-level line family: add `InternalRecordV2::SessionSettings`, a legacy `RolloutLine::SessionSettings` mirror for replay consumption, and both projector mappings.
- The sandbox settings patch persists explicitly; sandbox recovery precedence follows the approved patch-interaction rule (a `permissionProfile` line clears any explicit `sandboxProfile` override seen so far; a `sandboxProfile` line sets the override).
- **No epoch field in Phase 1**: line order in the append-only file already provides total ordering (per-file write lock), and no Phase 1 consumer needs epochs. The `epoch` column of DD-4 is introduced in Phase 2 when writes cross paths (handler-direct vs actor) and races become possible.
- **compaction/effective-window durability (updated 2026-09-08)**: supersedes the earlier global-`config.toml` design in DD-6. The applied window is model-derived and is never written to the rollout or `config.toml`; `session/metadata/update` only echoes it for older clients, and the former `compaction_token_limit` config field has been removed (leftover keys in old configs are ignored).
- **Ephemeral degrade (added 2026-08-02)**: ephemeral sessions have neither a rollout file nor a SQLite index row, so the persist-first path cannot apply. The canonical handler degrades through three metadata sources in order — rollout history (durable), SQLite index metadata, actor summary (the only mailbox read, explicitly scoped to the ephemeral degrade) — skipping field-line writes (ephemeral has no durability by definition) and building the response snapshot from the index/summary projection (`canonical_session_from_index_metadata`). Ephemeral sessions' settings updates remain fully functional; there is simply nothing to persist.
- **Model resolution for the effective-window echo (added 2026-08-02, updated 2026-09-08)**: session/new, restore, and the metadata-update echo resolve the session model through the same two-catalog chain as the legacy handler (workspace runtime-context catalog first, then the deps catalog), mailbox-free — the deps catalog alone misses models that only exist in workspace-scoped catalogs.
- **SQLite index refresh (added 2026-08-02)**: after a settings write the handler upserts the SQLite session index from index metadata + applied patch values, so the session list reflects new model/effort/preset values immediately instead of waiting for the next turn event.

## Risks and Mitigations

- **Split-brain during migration** (three copies: store / overlay / actor cache): single write path, epoch last-write-wins, dual-read divergence logging during the dual-write window; keep the window short.
- **Unattributable mid-turn behavior**: epoch-stamped traces and turn records (DD-8) are a precondition.
- **Synchronous disk I/O on the request path**: bounded wait with explicit error on failure; settings writes are rare, user-initiated actions.
- **Persisted-but-unacknowledged window**: idempotent retry via epoch last-write-wins; documented.
- **Half-live slices** (admission live, execution snapshot): one setting's write side and read side land in the same PR.
- **Flaky timing tests**: deterministic blocking fixtures only; no sleeps.
